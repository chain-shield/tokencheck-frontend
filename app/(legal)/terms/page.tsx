          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            By accessing or using the ChainShield ChainShield.ai platform (including the website <strong>chainshield.ai</strong> and related APIs) (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and <strong>ChainShield</strong> (the company providing the Service). If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Service. By using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms, and "you" will also refer to that organization. In addition, your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy (available on our website), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and have the legal capacity to enter into contracts to use this Service. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when creating an account for API access or other features. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials (such as API keys, username and password) and for all activities that occur under your account. <strong>You agree to notify ChainShield immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</strong> or security breach. ChainShield is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to safeguard your account. You may not share your login or API credentials with others, and you are responsible for any use by others that you have permitted to use your account.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Subscription Plans and Payments</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            ChainShield offers various subscription plans for access to certain features of the Service, including paid plans for API usage as described on our <a href="https://chainshield.ai/api-plans" className="text-primary hover:underline">API Plans</a> page. <strong>By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize ChainShield (or our third-party payment processor) to charge the subscription fee to your provided payment method on a recurring basis.</strong> Paid subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (e.g. monthly) unless you cancel your subscription prior to the next renewal date. We will bill the subscription fee in advance of each period. All fees are stated and charged in U.S. dollars (unless otherwise specified) and are exclusive of any taxes, which you are responsible for paying.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future renewal charges. Cancellation can be done through your account settings or by contacting our support. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to the paid features until the end of your current billing period (unless you request an earlier termination). <strong>Refund Policy:</strong> If you cancel a new subscription or a renewed subscription within five (5) days of the initial charge <strong>and provide a valid justification for your cancellation</strong>, ChainShield will, at its discretion, issue you a full refund of the subscription fee for that billing cycle. Valid justifications may include situations such as an unresolvable technical issue with the Service or the Service not being as described. No refunds will be provided for cancellation requests made more than 5 days after the charge, or for lack of use or partial use of the Service, except as required by applicable law. Aside from the 5-day cancellation refund described, all payments are non-refundable. If you downgrade your subscription plan, the change will take effect at the next billing cycle, and you will not be entitled to a refund for the current period. ChainShield reserves the right to adjust pricing for its subscription plans and any associated fees. If we change fees or plan features, we will provide advance notice (e.g. via the Service or email); the new fees will apply at the start of your next billing cycle. If you do not agree to a fee change, you may cancel your subscription before the new rates take effect.

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. No User-Generated Content</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            ChainShield's platform is a <strong>security analysis service</strong> and does not allow users to upload or post any user-generated content such as text, images, comments, or media. <strong>You will not submit any content to the Service except for cryptocurrency token addresses or identifiers for the purpose of analysis.</strong> The Service is limited to automated analysis of blockchain token addresses that you input. You acknowledge that you are not permitted to upload, transmit, or disseminate any other data or materials through our platform. Because users do not contribute content beyond analysis queries, you retain whatever ownership you have in the token addresses or data you submit, and you grant ChainShield the rights necessary to use that data for the purpose of providing the Service (for example, to perform risk analysis on the token address you submit). There are no public forums or publishing capabilities on this platform for user content, and thus sections of typical terms relating to user-generated content (such as content licenses to ChainShield or content takedowns) are not applicable here.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Acceptable Use and Conduct</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. <strong>You are strictly prohibited from:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>Using the Service in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation, including (but not limited to) securities laws, anti-money laundering laws, or any regulations regarding cryptocurrency or financial advice.</li>
            <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to, or disrupt the integrity or security of, the Service. This includes refraining from probing, scanning, or testing the vulnerability of our system or network, and not breaching any security or authentication measures.</li>
            <li>Using the Service to engage in any fraudulent, harmful, or malicious activities, or to facilitate or promote any activity that is illegal or violates the rights of others. You will not use the token analysis results to mislead others or for any unlawful financial activities.</li>
            <li>Submitting any information to the Service that is false, misleading, or that you do not have the right to provide. (For example, do not input data that contains any malicious code or any personal data other than blockchain addresses.)</li>
            <li>Using any automated means (such as scripts, bots, or scrapers) to access or use the website or API in a manner that sends more requests to the Service than permitted, or that otherwise interferes with the normal functioning of the Service. (The only permissible automated access is through our official API using your authorized credentials, within your plan limits – see Section 6.)</li>
            <li>Attempting to bypass or circumvent any usage limits, rate limits, or other restrictions that we impose on the Service. You may not create multiple accounts or use multiple API keys to exceed your subscribed plan's limits, and you may not use the Service in a way that unduly burdens our infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, or otherwise attempting to discover the source code or underlying proprietary algorithms of the Service, <strong>except to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation</strong>. You will not attempt to copy or replicate our token risk analysis service to create a competing product.</li>
            <li>Impersonating any person or entity, or misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, when using the Service or communicating with ChainShield.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Violation of this Acceptable Use policy may result in immediate suspension or termination of your access to the Service (including API access) and may expose you to legal liability. ChainShield reserves the right to investigate any suspected violation and cooperate with law enforcement in prosecuting users involved in unlawful activities.

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. API Access and Commercial Use</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            ChainShield offers an <strong>application programming interface (API)</strong> as part of the Service, which allows you to obtain automated token risk analysis for integration into your own applications or workflows. Access to the API is provided through subscription plans (see Section 3 above) and may require an API key or other authentication credentials. <strong>You must register for an API account and obtain valid credentials to use the API.</strong> The API, including all data obtained from it, is provided for your own use in accordance with these Terms and the usage limits of your chosen plan.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Usage Limits:</strong> Each subscription plan imposes limits on your API usage (for example, a maximum number of API calls per day) as described on our website. You agree not to exceed the rate or quantity of API calls permitted by your plan. The Service may enforce these limits by rejecting or throttling requests that exceed your allotment. Intentionally circumventing or manipulating usage limits (such as by creating multiple accounts or using technical means to avoid counting or restrictions) is considered a material breach of these Terms.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>License for API Use:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms and your payment of any applicable fees, ChainShield grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the ChainShield API and to retrieve and use the data from the API <strong>for your internal business purposes or personal use.</strong> If you have subscribed to a paid plan that permits commercial use, you may use the API and the analysis results in connection with your own commercial products or services (for example, integrating our token risk scores into your application for your users), <strong>provided</strong> that you do so within the usage limits of your plan and do not present our API or analysis as if it were your own proprietary analysis service. You may <strong>not</strong> redistribute, resell, or make available to third parties the raw outputs of our API as a standalone product or service; any use of the API data in a commercial context must add substantial value beyond simply repackaging our reports. Additionally, you may not share your API key with any unauthorized person or entity. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your API credentials. If you believe your API key or account has been compromised, you must notify us immediately.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Prohibited API Uses:</strong> In addition to the general Acceptable Use restrictions in Section 5, you specifically agree that you will not use the API in any manner that could harm the functionality or reliability of our Service or that violates any third-party rights. This includes not using the API to attempt to download or scrape our entire database, not using it to create a service that identifies or targets individuals (since our analysis is on tokens, not people), and not using the API for any unlawful activities. ChainShield may monitor API usage and, if we detect abuse or misuse, we may temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your API access. We will attempt to notify you of any suspected misuse and work with you to resolve the issue, but reserve the right to enforce usage limits or revoke access immediately to protect our Service and other users.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Commercial Use:</strong> We affirm that the API is available for commercial use under our paid plans. If you are on a free or trial plan, your use of the API should be limited to non-commercial testing, development, or personal projects; for any production or commercial deployment, a paid plan is required. By using the API, you acknowledge and agree to the specific terms and limitations of your plan (as outlined on the plans page or in a separate agreement for Enterprise plans). Enterprise customers may have a separate contract with ChainShield that provides customized terms; in the event of any conflict between such a contract and these Terms, the separate contract will control for the Enterprise customer.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including but not limited to the ChainShield.ai website, the API, the underlying technology, algorithms, software, reports, data, designs, and all content provided by ChainShield (collectively, the "ChainShield Content"), are owned by ChainShield or its licensors and are protected by United States and international intellectual property laws. <strong>ChainShield (and its licensors, if applicable) retain all intellectual property and proprietary rights in the Service and ChainShield Content.</strong> No rights or licenses are granted to you by implication or otherwise except for the limited use rights expressly granted in these Terms.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Limited License to Use Service:</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, ChainShield grants you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to access and use the Service (and to use any outputs or reports generated for you by the Service) solely for the purposes and in the manner expressly permitted by these Terms. This license is granted for the term of your authorization to use the Service (e.g., while you have an active account or subscription) and is for your internal use only. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or create derivative works from any part of the Service or the ChainShield Content, except as allowed by the Service's normal functionality or as expressly permitted by ChainShield in writing. For example, you are allowed to view analysis reports and use them for your own decision-making, and if you are an API user on a commercial plan, you may incorporate our analysis results into your own application within the scope permitted (see Section 6), but you cannot, say, scrape our entire database of token analyses to create a competing service.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Trademarks:</strong> The name <strong>ChainShield</strong>, <strong>ChainShield.ai</strong>, and our logos, slogans, or any other trademarks or service marks used on the Service are proprietary to ChainShield. You are not permitted to use any ChainShield trademarks without our prior written consent.

ChainShield has no obligation to implement any Feedback or keep it confidential.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">8. Disclaimers of Warranties and No Financial Advice</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Use at Your Own Risk:</strong> The Service and all information, content, and materials provided by ChainShield (including but not limited to token risk reports, security analyses, API data, or any results or outputs of the Service) are provided on an <strong>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE"</strong> basis, <strong>without any warranties of any kind</strong>, either express or implied. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. ChainShield <strong>does not guarantee, represent, or warrant</strong> that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of defects, viruses, or other harmful components. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, ChainShield disclaims all warranties, express or implied, in connection with the Service and your use thereof, including but not limited to <strong>implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>No Guarantee of Results or Accuracy:</strong> You acknowledge that <strong>ChainShield does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of any analysis, report, or information provided through the Service.</strong> The token risk scores, security assessments, and other analyses are generated based on our algorithms and available data, and while we strive for high quality and up-to-date information, <strong>there is no guarantee that the results are correct or complete.</strong> Cryptocurrency projects and token contracts can change rapidly, and there may be errors or false positives/negatives in our analyses. <strong>ChainShield makes no warranty or representation that any token is safe or reliable</strong> or that our analysis will identify every risk or threat associated with a given token. You should not rely on the Service as your sole source of information about a token.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Informational Purposes Only – No Financial or Investment Advice:</strong> All information provided by the Service (including risk ratings, reports, or any commentary) is for <strong>informational purposes only</strong>. ChainShield is <strong>not</strong> an investment advisor, broker-dealer, or financial planner, and <strong>nothing in the Service constitutes professional financial or investment advice.</strong> ChainShield's analyses and reports <strong>should not be relied upon for making investment decisions or other financial decisions.</strong> In particular, a favorable risk report on a token is not an endorsement or recommendation to buy, sell, or hold that token, and an unfavorable report is not a recommendation against it – it is simply an automated analysis of certain risk factors. <strong>You are solely responsible for any decisions you make regarding cryptocurrencies or tokens.</strong> Any investment or trading in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks, including the risk of loss of principal, and <strong>you should conduct your own research and due diligence</strong> beyond what is provided by our Service. We strongly encourage you to consult with a licensed financial advisor or other qualified professional before making any investment decisions based on information from the Service. ChainShield disclaims any liability for actions you take or fail to take based on information obtained through the Service.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>No Warranty for Third-Party Data or Services:</strong> Our Service may rely on data from third-party sources (for example, blockchain data providers or other databases). We do not guarantee the accuracy or availability of any third-party data. Additionally, if our website or reports contain links to third-party websites or services, ChainShield provides those links for convenience only and does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any third-party content or services. If you access any third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or conditions, so some of the above disclaimers may not fully apply to you. In such cases, any implied warranties will be limited to the minimum scope permitted by law.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will ChainShield or its parent company, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, or licensors be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever.</strong> This includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits, lost savings or revenue, loss of data, loss of business or opportunity, or any other intangible losses or damages arising out of or related to: (a) your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Service (including the use of or inability to use the API); (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (c) any information or content obtained from the Service (including reliance on any token risk report or analysis); or (d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or data, <strong>even if</strong> ChainShield has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In particular, <strong>ChainShield will not be liable for any investment losses or financial losses</strong> that you may incur by using or relying on information from the Service. You acknowledge that the cryptocurrency markets are volatile and that any decision to invest in or divest from a token involves risk that is independent of our analysis.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Limitation of Direct Damages:</strong> To the extent that any liability is not legally excludable, <strong>the total cumulative liability of ChainShield and its affiliates to you for any and all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service shall not exceed the amount actually paid by you to ChainShield for the Service in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim</strong> (or, if you have not paid any fees to ChainShield, $100 USD). This limitation applies collectively to all types of claims (whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, statute, or any other legal theory).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The limitations above form an essential basis of the bargain between you and ChainShield, and <strong>you acknowledge that ChainShield would not be able to provide the Service on an economically feasible basis without these limitations.</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages; in such jurisdictions, ChainShield's liability shall be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">10. Indemnification</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ChainShield, its parent company, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, and partners (collectively, the "<strong>Indemnified Parties</strong>") from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) that arise out of or relate to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Your use or misuse of the Service or any information obtained from the Service;</strong></li>

          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            ChainShield reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations). In such case, you agree to cooperate with ChainShield's defense of that claim and you shall not settle any such claim without ChainShield's prior written consent. This indemnification obligation will survive any termination of your account or of the Service, and it applies to any use of the Service by an employee, contractor, or agent authorized by you or using your account or credentials.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">11. Dispute Resolution – Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 font-bold">
            Please read this section carefully, as it affects your legal rights. It provides for resolution of disputes through <strong>binding individual arbitration</strong> instead of in court, and includes a <strong>waiver of class actions and jury trials.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate:</strong> Except for the exceptions expressly stated below, <strong>you and ChainShield agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis.</strong> This includes disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination. You and ChainShield <strong>waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury</strong>, and you also waive the ability to participate in a class action or any other representative proceeding for such disputes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Arbitration Procedure:</strong> The arbitration will be administered by a neutral arbitration provider mutually agreed upon by the parties (for example, the American Arbitration Association (AAA)), under the rules of the selected arbitration provider applicable to consumer disputes (if you are an individual using the Service for personal or small business use) or the rules applicable to commercial disputes (if you are using the Service in the scope of an enterprise or for commercial purposes). <strong>If AAA is chosen, the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, except as modified by these Terms.</strong> If the chosen provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum by mutual agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. The arbitration may be conducted in person in a location that is reasonably convenient for both parties (if you and ChainShield cannot agree on a location, the arbitrator will have the power to determine the location, or the arbitration may proceed via telephone or video conference as appropriate) or entirely via electronic submissions, as determined by the arbitrator. <strong>The language of the arbitration shall be English.</strong> The arbitrator will have authority to award legal and equitable relief, including interim or preliminary relief, just as a court would. <strong>Any award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties</strong>, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs, unless the arbitrator finds that a claim or defense was frivolous or brought in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award the prevailing party their fees and costs, or unless an applicable statute provides for recovery of fees and costs. <strong>The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1 et seq.) will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement, and the arbitrator shall apply U.S. substantive law consistent with the FAA.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, you and ChainShield <strong>each retain the right</strong> to: (a) <strong>bring an individual action in small claims court</strong> for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction, <strong>and</strong> (b) <strong>seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction</strong> to prevent or enjoin infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's intellectual property rights or confidential information. In addition, if you are a consumer, you retain the right to lodge a complaint with a relevant governmental or regulatory agency.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Waiver of Class Actions:</strong> <strong>You and ChainShield agree that all claims and disputes will be resolved on an individual basis, and not on a class, collective, or representative basis.</strong> <strong>YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS ARBITRATION</strong> against ChainShield. The arbitrator is only authorized to provide relief to you as an individual and only to the extent necessary to resolve your individual claim; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated, nor may the arbitrator otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. <strong>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, then the entirety of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 11 shall be null and void, and in that case you and ChainShield agree that jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction) shall govern any lawsuit arising out of the dispute.</strong> However, the provisions of the preceding paragraph concerning waiver of the right to jury trial shall continue to apply.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial:</strong> <strong>To the extent any dispute is found by a court to not be subject to arbitration, or if the arbitration agreement is otherwise not enforced, you and ChainShield each knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to a jury trial in any court proceeding.</strong> You and ChainShield understand that absent this provision, you would have had the right to a jury trial, but you expressly and knowingly choose to waive it.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This Section 11 (Dispute Resolution) shall survive any termination of these Terms. If for any reason a dispute between you and ChainShield proceeds in court rather than arbitration (for instance, if you opt out of arbitration or the arbitration clause is held unenforceable), <strong>you and ChainShield agree that such a suit shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the State of Delaware, USA</strong>, and you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">12. Termination</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>By ChainShield:</strong> ChainShield reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service (including any account or API access) at any time, with or without notice, and with or without cause. For example, we may terminate or suspend your account if we determine that: (a) you have violated these Terms (or any applicable policies or guidelines), (b) you have engaged in behavior that is unlawful, abusive, or that harms or may harm other users, third parties, or the integrity of the Service, (c) you fail to pay any fees when due (for paid plans), or (d) we choose to discontinue the Service or materially alter its functionality. We will endeavor to provide advance notice to you in cases of non-egregious violations or discontinuation of service, but we are not obligated to do so.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If we terminate your account due to a violation of these Terms or law, you will not be entitled to any refunds for any portion of fees paid (and, in serious cases, we may also refuse to provide you any future use of the Service). If we terminate your access without cause (for instance, if we decide to shut down the Service entirely), we will refund any prepaid fees on a pro-rata basis for the remaining portion of your subscription term if you have a paid subscription.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>By You:</strong> You may terminate your account or stop using the Service at any time. If you wish to delete your account, you may do so through the account settings (if available) or by contacting us at our support email. Termination of your account will be effective once processed by ChainShield. If you terminate a paid subscription, you will remain responsible for any charges already incurred up to the date of termination. (See Section 3 regarding cancellations and refunds – generally, if you terminate outside the 5-day refund window and before the end of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for that period but will retain access until the period ends.)
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon any termination of your access or account, whether by you or by ChainShield, all licenses and rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease. You must cease all use of the Service, and destroy any local copies of any software, documentation, or ChainShield Content obtained through the Service that are in your possession or control (except that you may retain any reports or analysis results you obtained during your subscription for your records, provided you continue to respect ChainShield's intellectual property rights in those materials). ChainShield may, at its discretion, delete or deactivate your account and all related data (excluding any archival backups) from our systems. <strong>Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including but not limited to disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, dispute resolution, and general provisions) shall survive any termination.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Termination of the Service or your access to it shall not limit any of ChainShield's rights or remedies at law or in equity resulting from your breach of these Terms prior to such termination.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">13. Modifications to Service and Terms</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Changes to the Service:</strong> ChainShield is continually improving and evolving the Service. As such, we <strong>reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue</strong> any part of the Service (or the entire Service), temporarily or permanently, at any time. We may add or remove functionalities or features, impose additional limits on certain features, or restrict access to parts or all of the Service. We will endeavor to notify users of any major changes that would significantly affect the way the Service is used (for example, by posting an announcement on our website or sending an email to subscribers), but we are not obligated to provide notice for minor changes or those that do not materially affect the rights or obligations of users. You agree that ChainShield shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service, provided that if you are a paying subscriber and we discontinue the Service entirely, we will issue any refunds as described in Section 12.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Changes to Terms:</strong> We may revise or update these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. When we make material changes to the Terms, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by posting a notice on our site or sending a notification to the email address associated with your account. The "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms will reflect the effective date of the latest revisions. <strong>By continuing to access or use the Service after updated Terms have taken effect, you indicate that you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</strong> If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and, if applicable, cancel your subscription. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Service.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Please note that any modifications to these Terms will not apply to any dispute between you and ChainShield that arose prior to the effective date of the changes. In addition, if we update the Terms and you have paid for a fixed-term subscription, the version of Terms that were in effect at the start of that term will generally remain in effect for that term unless we notify you otherwise or you expressly agree to the new Terms.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to them or the Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>State of Delaware, USA</strong>, and, to the extent applicable, the federal laws of the United States, <strong>without giving effect to any conflict of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.</strong> If a dispute is not subject to arbitration (either because the arbitration agreement is found unenforceable or because one of the exceptions in Section 11 applies), then you and ChainShield agree that <strong>any judicial proceeding must be brought in the courts of competent jurisdiction (state or federal) located in the State of Delaware</strong>. Both you and ChainShield consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there, and waive any objection on the grounds of inconvenient forum or any similar doctrine. However, we both agree that either party may seek to enforce a judgment or seek interim relief (such as an injunction for intellectual property infringement) in any jurisdiction as necessary.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you access the Service from a location outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Regardless of your location, the obligations and rights under these Terms will be interpreted and enforced as a matter of U.S. law.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">15. Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (together with any documents or policies expressly incorporated by reference, such as our Privacy Policy and any applicable Subscription or Enterprise Agreement) constitute the <strong>entire agreement</strong> between you and ChainShield with respect to the Service, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, communications, and proposals, whether written or oral, regarding the Service. <strong>No oral or written information or advice given by ChainShield, its representatives, or any third party</strong> shall create any warranty or representation not expressly stated in these Terms, and you may not rely on any such information or advice.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Severability:</strong> In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms. The parties shall replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, to the extent possible under applicable law.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Waiver:</strong> No failure or delay by ChainShield in exercising any right, power, or remedy under these Terms shall operate as a waiver of that right or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy preclude any further exercise of that or any other right, power, or remedy. <strong>Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of ChainShield.</strong> The rights and remedies provided to ChainShield in these Terms are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms, nor any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without ChainShield's prior written consent. Any attempt to assign these Terms without such consent will be null and void. ChainShield may freely assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) to any third party, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> Except as expressly provided in these Terms, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement. These Terms are for the benefit of you and ChainShield only. However, ChainShield's affiliates, officers, employees, and agents are entitled to the protections of Sections 8 and 9 (Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability) and may enforce those provisions as intended third-party beneficiaries.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> ChainShield will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of its obligations under these Terms to the extent such failure or delay is caused by events beyond ChainShield's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil disturbances, government actions, labor disputes, failure of telecommunications or data networks, or other events of force majeure.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Headings and Interpretation:</strong> Section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Words such as "including" and "include" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." These Terms shall not be interpreted against the drafter (each party having had the opportunity to review and negotiate the terms).

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Communications and Notices:</strong> We may send you information relating to the Service and your account (e.g. updates, security alerts, account notices) electronically, such as via email to the address you provided or by posting on the Service. You are deemed to have received those communications when we send them or post them, whether or not you actually review them. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information (including your email address) up to date. If you need to send any notices to ChainShield regarding this Agreement, you must do so in writing via email or certified mail as described in the Contact Information section below.
